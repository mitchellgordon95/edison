# Chapter 7: Future Plans
# Lesson 1:  Group Blocks

# To define a subworkflow in the same file:
# NOTE: Packages are not allowed following group definition
func group TM < in1=x.txt > out1=$out@Y {
  task X < in=$in1@TM > out {
    cat < $in >$out
  }
  task Y : my_fine_tool < in=$out@X > out {
    cat < $in > $out
  }
}

# Groups cause nested directory structure
# Any functions declared within a group are local to that function
# TODO: A func group can be instantiated as a task later
