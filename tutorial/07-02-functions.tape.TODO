# Chapter 7: Future Plans
# Lesson 2:  Functions

# To define a "task function" in the same file
# Functions may not declare submitters -- the mapping onto resources is separated out.
func filter : cdec < in > out {
  cat < $in > $out
}

# XXX: Still looks a bit odd
# Using that function or subworkflow later in the file:
# (Require naming inputs and outputs again for clarity, but
#   omit commands)
task X calls filter : cdec < in=x.txt > out
